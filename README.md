kibana Authentication Proxy
============

Hosts the latest [kibana3](www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/) and elasticsearch behind Google OAuth2, Basic Authentication or CAS Authentication with NodeJS and Express.

- A proxy between Elasticsearch, kibana3 and user client
- Support Elasticsearch which protected by basic authentication, only kibana-authentication-proxy knows the user/passwd
- Compatible with the latest kibana3
- Enhanced authentication methods. Now support Google OAuth2, BasicAuth(multiple users supported) and CAS Authentication for the clients
- Inspired by and based on [kibana-proxy](https://github.com/hmalphettes/kibana-proxy), most of the proxy libraries were written by them, thanks:)

*We NO LONGER support third-party plugins such as `Bigdesk` or `Head` since it's hard to test and maintain*
