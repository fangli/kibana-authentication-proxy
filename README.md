kibana Authentication Proxy
============

Hosts the latest [kibana3](www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/) and elasticsearch behind Google OAuth2, Basic Authentication or CAS Authentication with NodeJS and Express.

- A proxy between Elasticsearch, kibana3 and user client
- Support Elasticsearch which protected by basic authentication, only kibana-authentication-proxy knows the user/passwd
- Compatible with the latest kibana3
- Enhanced authentication methods. Now support Google OAuth2, BasicAuth(multiple users supported) and CAS Authentication for the clients
- Per-user kibana index supported. now you can use index kibana-int-userA for user A and kibana-int-userB for user B
- Inspired by and based on [kibana-proxy](https://github.com/hmalphettes/kibana-proxy), most of the proxy libraries were written by them, thanks:)

*We NO LONGER support third-party plugins such as `Bigdesk` or `Head` since it's hard to test and maintain*

Installation
=====

```
# git clone https://github.com/fangli/kibana-authentication-proxy
# cd kibana-authentication-proxy/
# git submodule init
# git submodule update
# npm install

// You may want to update the built-in kibana3 to the latest version, just run
# cd kibana && git checkout master && git pull

// Then edit config.js, make sure you have everything checked in the config file
// and run!
# node app.js
```

Configuration
=============

All settings are placed in /config.js, hack it as you go.

### Elasticsearch backend configurations

- ``es_host``:  *The host of ElasticSearch*
- ``es_port``:  *The port of ElasticSearch*
- ``es_using_ssl``:  *If the ES is using SSL(https)?*
- ``es_username``:  *(optional) The basic authentication user of ES server, leave it blank if no basic auth applied*
- ``es_password``:  *(optional) The password of basic authentication of ES server, leave it blank if no basic auth applied*

### Client settings

- ``listen_port``:  *The listen port of kibana3*
- ``brower_cache_maxage``:  *The browser cache max-Age controll, for a better loading speed*
- ``enable_ssl_port``: *Enable SSL or not?*
- ``listen_port_ssl``: *If enable_ssl_port set to true, this is the port of SSL*
- ``ssl_key_file``: *Point to the ssl key file*
- ``ssl_cert_file``: *Point to the ssl certification file*
- ``kibana_es_index``: *The ES index for saving kibana dashboards, now per-user configurations supported. using %user% instead of the username*
- ``which_auth_type_for_kibana_index``: *Where the variable %user% comes from? which authentication type you want to use for it?*
- ``cookie_secret``: *The secret token for cookies. replace it with a random string for security*

### Client authentication settings

We currently support 3 auth methods: Google OAuth2, BasicAuth and CAS, you can use one of them or all of them. it depends on the configuration you have.

***1. Google OAuth2***

- ``enable_google_oauth``: *Enable or not?*
- ``client_id``:  *The client ID of Google OAuth2, leave empty if you don't want to use it*
- ``client_secret``: *The client secret of Google OAuth2*
- ``allowed_emails``: *An emails list for the authorized users, should like `["a@b.com", "*@b.com", "*"]`*. All google users in the list will be allowed to access kibana.

**Important**

Google OAuth2 needs authorized redirect URIs for your app, please add it first as below, ``http://YOUR-KIBANA-SITE:[listen_port]/auth/google/callback`` in production or ``http://localhost:[listen_port]/auth/google/callback`` for local test

***2. Basic Authentication***

- ``enable_basic_auth``: *Enable or not?*
- ``basic_auth_users``:  *A list of user/passwd, see the comments in config.js for help. leave empty if you won't use it*
- ``basic_auth_file``:  *if is specified and exists, the user password combinations are read from the named file and overrule the here defined settings from array basic_auth_users. File format is one combination per line split by first appearing colon

***3. CAS Auth***

- ``enable_cas_auth``: *Enable or not?*
- ``cas_server_url``: *Point to the CAS server URL*

### Client Index Filter Settings

Only makes sense when authentication is active. With this you can achieve some kind of authorization, that said meaning you can restrict access for certain users to certain elastisearch indizes

- ``index_filter_file``: *if defined links to a flatfile in user:regex\n notation with regex applied to wished elasticsearch indizes, see also the comments in config.js*
- ``index_filter_trigger``: *if defined is a regex which determines (most time the prefix) for which index filtering will be applied, see also the comments in config.js*
